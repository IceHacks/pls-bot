# PlsBot
### Warning! You will get banned for using this. I do not use this and I am not responsible for what happens to you.

This is the recreation of a spambot I made before the ban. I just updated it to work with **DankMemer** and gave it a UI. This is just for educational purposes and because my friends wanted a UI. I think I did a good job on the UI, although not very scalable lol.

I will not tell you how to get your token.

## Installing

-   Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/IceHacks/pls-bot/releases/latest)
    -   Download the file for your system (EXE for Windows, DMG for Mac, ...)
-   Install the program
-   Run the program

    -   Enter your (or your alts) Discord token
    -   Enter the ID of the channel you wish to bot in
    -   Enter the amount of cash you want your bot to bet

There are some features of this left out because I don't want to give them to you. But maybe I'll make more available later. If you use this (I suggest not) your should use an alt account that is not signed in. And use that account as your hidden personal bank.

IceHacks.

## Building

This part is for Developers or people on unsupported systems. It will show you how to make a binary for yourself. You will need NodeJS and Git.
